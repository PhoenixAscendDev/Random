## Budget Cost Module ‚Äì Business Rule Statements

### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: PriceSource

> A **PriceSource** is a single recorded price for a specific **CulinaryItem**, offered by a specific **retail source**, in a defined **unit of measure** and **package size** at a specific **date/time**.
---

### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: PriceAggregator

> A **PriceAggregator** is a business logic unit that consolidates multiple `PriceSource` records for the same **CulinaryItem**, **unit of measure**, and **package size** into a single computed price summary, which contains **mathematical aggregation** and **price grouping criteria**.

---
### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: IngredientDensityBridge

> An **IngredientDensityBridge** is a fixed ratio that defines the relationship between a **volume-based unit** and a **weight-based unit** for a specific **RawIngredient**.
---

### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: Density

> Every **CulinaryItem** has a **Density** that defines the quantity of **mass within a volume**.
> The **base density unit** is **`lb/cup`**.
---

### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: Pantry Savings

> **Pantry Savings** is the avoided cost of using an ingredient already owned at the time of cooking.
> It is calculated based on the **PriceAggregate** of the amount used, regardless of when or how the ingredient was acquired.
> Pantry Savings reflects the **financial value preserved** by not needing to repurchase the ingredient at today‚Äôs price.

---
### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: Effective Purchase Cost

> **Effective Purchase Cost** is the proportional amount of a purchased ingredient‚Äôs price that corresponds to the quantity used in a recipe, using the **PriceAggregate** of an ingredient.
> Effective Purchase Cost reflects the **actual financial cost incurred** for the portion of an ingredient used from a purchase.

---

### üéúÔ∏è Business Rule: Pantry Cost Delta

> **Pantry Cost Delta** is the difference between the original purchase price of an ingredient and its current market at the time it is used.
> It is calculated by comparing the **Effective Purchase Cost** to the **Pantry Savings** for the same quantity.
> Pantry Cost Delta reflects the **change in ingredient value** between the time of purchase and the time of use.
